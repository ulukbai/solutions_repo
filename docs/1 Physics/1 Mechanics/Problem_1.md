# Projectile Motion: Range vs Launch Angle

## üéØ Objective
The goal of this project is to explore how the horizontal distance (range) of a projectile depends on the angle at which it's launched. This is a classic problem in physics, but it‚Äôs also a great example of how mathematical models describe real-world motion.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Theoretical Background
The equation for the range \( R \) of a projectile (assuming no air resistance and launch/landing at the same height) is:

\[
R = \frac{v_0^2 \cdot \sin(2\theta)}{g}
\]

Where:
- \( v_0 \) is the initial velocity,
- \( \theta \) is the launch angle,
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s¬≤).

This formula shows that the range depends on the sine of **double** the launch angle. The range reaches a maximum when \( \theta = 45^\circ \), because \( \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \).

## üíª Implementation

The simulation is written in Python using `numpy` and `matplotlib`. It calculates and plots the projectile range for angles between 0¬∞ and 90¬∞, with a fixed initial speed.
