This is a classic problem in physics, but it\u2019s also a great example of how mathematical models describe real-world motion. \u2699\ufe0f Theoretical Background The equation for the range \\( R \\) of a projectile (assuming no air resistance and launch/landing at the same height) is: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\cdot \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] Where: - \\( v_0 \\) is the initial velocity, - \\( \\theta \\) is the launch angle, - \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s\u00b2). This formula shows that the range depends on the sine of double the launch angle. The range reaches a maximum when \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) , because \\( \\sin(90^\\circ) = 1 \\) . \ud83d\udcbb Implementation The simulation is written in Python using numpy and matplotlib . It calculates and plots the projectile range for angles between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, with a fixed initial speed.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#set-up-basic-initial-conditions","text":"initial_velocity = 50 # m/s gravity = 9.81 # m/s\u00b2","title":"Set up basic initial conditions"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#generate-a-list-of-angles-from-0-to-90-degrees","text":"angles_deg = np.linspace(0, 90, 500) angles_rad = np.radians(angles_deg) # Convert degrees to radians","title":"Generate a list of angles from 0 to 90 degrees"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#calculate-projectile-range-for-each-angle-using-the-classic-physics-formula","text":"","title":"Calculate projectile range for each angle using the classic physics formula"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#r-v2-sin2-g","text":"ranges = (initial_velocity ** 2) * np.sin(2 * angles_rad) / gravity","title":"R = (v^2 * sin(2\u03b8)) / g"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#plot-the-results","text":"plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) plt.plot(angles_deg, ranges, color='steelblue', label=f'Initial speed = {initial_velocity} m/s') plt.title('Projectile Range vs Launch Angle') plt.xlabel('Launch Angle (degrees)') plt.ylabel('Range (meters)') plt.grid(True) plt.legend() plt.tight_layout() plt.show()","title":"Plot the results"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#projectile-motion-range-vs-launch-angle","text":"","title":"Projectile Motion: Range vs Launch Angle"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#objective","text":"The goal of this project is to explore how the horizontal distance (range) of a projectile depends on the angle at which it's launched.
